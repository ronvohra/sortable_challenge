# sortable_challenge
Contains the source code for my attempt to solve the Sortable coding challenge.

The code is self-contained, just needs to be run as a regular Python script, viz.``python challenge.py``. 

It creates an output file called ``results.txt`` in the folder from which you ran the command. This file has been successfully validated as specified in the challenge.
